          Hey there! üëãüèΩ As someone who's worn many hats, from full-time nanny to
          trade marketing assistant, I've always been drawn to diverse
          experiences and new challenges. Recently, I've taken the leap into the
          world of web development, and I couldn't be more excited!
        </p>

        <p>
          With a background in business and childcare, I bring a unique mix of
          skills to the table. Think problem-solving, adaptability, and a knack
          for connecting with people. Now, I'm diving headfirst into frontend
          and backend development, with eagerness and curiosity to really
          immerse myself in this new passion.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not busy coding, you'll often find me with my Kindle in hand,
          on a mat practicing Ashtanga yoga, or in the search for a new favorite
          restaurant.
        </p>
